In Java, non-primitive data types are ________, and one example is a(n) ________.`,

      '"predefined", "integer"',
      '"not predefined", "string"',
      '"predefined", "array"',
      "None of the above"
    ],
    answer: 1,
    solution:
      "Primitive types, like int or boolean, are immediately defined \
(in this case, 0 and false respectively), even if you haven't assigned a value to it. \
Likewise, non-primitive types, like string or array, are not immediately defined."
